# Command Center – Backend Simulation (Relational Database Training)

## Overview
Command Center is a backend-focused simulation project designed to practice relational database design and multi-layered architecture. The game simulates hierarchical decision-making from company-level to strategic levels.

## Key Contributions & Learning

Designed and implemented a relational database with hierarchical relationships (Soldier → Squad → Platoon → Company → Battalion → Brigade)

Developed DAO and logic layers in Java using JDBC

Practiced multi-layered backend architecture and database-driven application design

Implemented CRUD operations and queries using SQL

## Tech Stack

Java (JDBC) – DAO and logic layer implementation

PostgreSQL – relational database schema design with foreign key relationships

SQL – CRUD operations and data handling

## Future Extensions

Extend logic layer to simulate strategic decision-making

Implement GUI for interactive gameplay
